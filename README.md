# ❤️ Classification of QRS Complexes of ECG Traces 🩺
Welcome to the repository for the Final Year Project (FYP) titled Classification of QRS Complexes of ECG Traces, conducted during an educational internship. This project was part of the author's final year in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (specializing in Telecommunications) at the Lebanese University.

## 📚 Project Overview
This project dives into the fascinating field of cardiac signal analysis, focusing on the classification of QRS complexes from ECG traces using machine learning. 
The main objectives were:
- 🎯 Enhancing classification accuracy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
-🔬 Simulating ECG signals to overcome data limitations and support biomedical research.

## 📂 Contents
