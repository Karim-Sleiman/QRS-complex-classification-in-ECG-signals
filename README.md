# ❤️ Classification of QRS Complexes of ECG Traces 🩺
Welcome to the repository for my Final Year Project (FYP) titled Classification of QRS Complexes of ECG Traces, conducted during an educational internship. This project was part of my final year in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (specializing in Telecommunications) at the Lebanese University.

## 📚 Project Overview
This project dives into the field of cardiac signal analysis, focusing on the classification of QRS complexes from ECG traces using machine learning. 
The main objectives were:
- 🎯 Enhancing classification accuracy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- 🔬 Simulating ECG signals to overcome data limitations and support biomedical research.

## 📂 Contents
### 1. 🧠 Background
    Introduction to the electrical activity of the heart and QRS complex classification.
    Challenges in manual classification by medical professionals and how AI can help.
    
### 2. 📊 Data
    📈 Data sourced from real-world ECG signals with annotations for ventricular arrhythmias.
    🛠️ Preprocessing steps like noise removal, filtering, and normalization.
    
### 3. 🤖 Classification
    🛠️ Built a CNN-based model for binary classification (left/right ventricular arrhythmias).
    🏆 Achieved an 81% accuracy, with opportunities for improvement.
    
### 4. 🌀 Simulation
    Developed multiple approaches to simulate ECG signals, including:
    Mathematical modeling 📐
    Data-driven methods 🧮
    Applied signal-processing techniques such as the Savitzky–Golay filter and wavelet transforms for realistic ECG generation.
